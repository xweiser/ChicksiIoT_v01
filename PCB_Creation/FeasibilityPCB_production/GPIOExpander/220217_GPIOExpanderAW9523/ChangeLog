## Expierience with version v01
The board is not working
1st reason: Switch is wrongly mounted (need to be turned by 90 degr.) However footprint does not match
2nd reason:
I2C Interface is not responding usind i2C Scanner in Arduino examples
Tested:
Arduino UNO and Arduino Leonardo
VCC = 5 Volt and VCC=3.3 Volt - not responding
Jumper 1 = 1 shortend: not responding
Soldered form JLPCB and soldered myselfe: no difference = not responding
